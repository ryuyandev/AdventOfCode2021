## Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my solutions to the enjoyable programming puzzles in the [2021 advent calendar of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

See [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about)

## Personal Goals

- Complete all 50 puzzles
- Write all code only within a browser @ replit.com
- Use Git via replit.com
- No excessively slow solutions
- Running all 50 puzzles sequentially should complete in a reasonable amount of time
- Have fun in a language I enjoy

## Notes

I chose JavaScript since it's my favorite language.
I would have used TypeScript, but running TypeScript via replit.com had an unacceptable
startup delay, presumably due to compilation. For local development this is a non-issue,
as I've seen compile times quick enough to not impede development flow even when making
many quick changes, but I wanted to try to complete this only using replit.com, 
so I preferred to keep minimal the time between pressing "Run" and receiving a result.

## Usage

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` to run all puzzles ||  
  `npm run day1:puzzle1` to run a single puzzle
